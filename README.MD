Welcome to the sample github actions workflow setup.

Added first workflow.

Added second workflow.

Note - Here, out workflow works only when changes gets pushed to main branch or the name of branch should be pre defined in YAML file.

Assignment Question = If we want that if we push some changes to any branch of repo, our workflow should work, how can we achieve it?

Created assignment.yml file for it.
